                <p>Erick Joisel was a profitable artist who lives since the 50's till 2010. He made Origami since he was in his20's. In his own words: "I must have spent around of 30 thousands hours making different kind of <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami" target="_blank">origami</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>There is Joisel:</p>

                <p>He developed a revolutionary technique which allows to the artist to make origamis more precisely. It
                    consists on making a grid which will help with the structure of it. It is called "tessellation".</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are some examples:</p>

                <p>With this technique, he expanded the range of the origami-figures that can be make. Nowdays, the NASA and
                    other others companies are using this concepts to build more sophisticated telescopes, nanorobots, medical
                    tools, etc.</p>

                <p>There are some examples of the art that Joisel could made using the tessellation:</p>
